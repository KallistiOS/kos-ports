libzip is a cross-platform ZIP library developed since 2005 that runs on Linux,
macOS, Windows, and other operating systems. It prioritizes API stability, data
integrity, and efficiency while supporting modern ZIP features including Zip64
for large archives, multiple compression algorithms (Deflate, bzip2, LZMA,
zstd), and various encryption methods. The library can read from files or memory
buffers, allows reverting changes, and uses a BSD license making it suitable for
commercial use.

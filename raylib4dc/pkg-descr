This is the MicroPython project, which aims to put an implementation of
Python 3.x on microcontrollers and small embedded systems. This project is in
Beta stage and is subject to changes of the code-base, including project-wide
name changes and API changes.

MicroPython implements the entire Python 3.4 syntax and some select features
from later versions.

MicroPython can execute scripts in textual source form (.py files) or from
precompiled bytecode (.mpy files).

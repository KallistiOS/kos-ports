MAD is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder.

It currently supports MPEG-1 and the MPEG-2 extension to lower sampling
frequencies, as well as the de facto MPEG 2.5 format. All three audio
layers — Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III (i.e. MP3) — are fully implemented.

MAD has the following special features:

    24-bit PCM output
    100% fixed-point (integer) computation
    completely new implementation based on the ISO/IEC standards
    available under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL)

libexif is a library for parsing, editing, and saving EXIF data. It is
intended to replace lots of redundant implementations in command-line
utilities and programs with GUIs.

libexif supports parsing, editing and saving of EXIF data. In addition, it
has gettext support. All EXIF tags described in EXIF standard 2.1 (and most
from 2.2) are supported.  Many maker notes from Canon, Casio, Epson,
Fuji, Nikon, Olympus, Pentax and Sanyo cameras are also supported.

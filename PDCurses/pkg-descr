PDCurses is a public domain curses library for DOS, OS/2, Windows console, 
X11 and SDL, implementing most of the functions available in X/Open and 
System V R4 curses, and supporting a variety of compilers for these platforms. 
The X11 and SDL ports let you recompile existing text-mode curses programs to 
produce GUI applications.

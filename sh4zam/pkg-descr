SH4ZAM is a hand-optimized, general-purpose math and linear algebra library for harnessing the floating-point power of the SH4 processor in the Sega Dreamcast. It originally began as a collection of inline assembly routines developed specifically to accelerate the math in the Grand Theft Auto 3 and Vice City DC ports. These routines, along with many others from various contributors, have been separated and combined into a single standalone library, which can be leveraged to bring gainz to the Dreamcast and SuperH communities at large.
